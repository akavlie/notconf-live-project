## Let's Get this Wagon Train a Movin'
Living Cowboy is a project that showcases the talents of many individuals. The goal is to have fun and create something awesome, while showing off your development prowess. Read the directions and rules below before getting started and then you're off to the cattle drive.

Periodically throughout the day (about every half hour) we will be looking at the pull requests and pushing the coolest ones we see, live to http://cowboy.notconf.com. After the conference we will be putting everyones submissions live on the site for all to see.

For those that are attending NotConf, for your pull request you will get entered into a raffle to win a new iPad. Those of you who couldn't make it out we'd love to see what you have, even if you can't enter into the raffle. We'll stop taking pull requests at 4PM so make sure they are in, then come check in with us to ensure you're entered into the raffle.

## Directions
- **Step 1:** Fork this repository and clone your fork.
- **Step 2:** run npm install
- **Step 3:** run ./bin/yeehaw create <github username> <source github username>
_note:_ The source github username is optional. Use that if you want to build off of someone elses submission.
- **Step 4:** Start creating something amazing.
- **Step 4:** Once finished, perform a pull request.
- **Step 5:** Come check in with us to be entered in the raffle.

## Rules
- Your name, github username, or twitter handle must be visible somewhere on the page.
- You must have a folder named with your github username under the  submissions folder. That way we don't have merge conflicts.
- You can duplicate another users folder and build off of their work; however you cannot remove that users information from the page.
- Everything you start with must be there when you are done and perform your pull request.
- Anyone is welcome to participate; however you can only win if you are attending NotConf.
